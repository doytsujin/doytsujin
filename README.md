#### About

As a Subject Matter Expert, my focus lies in leveraging AI/ML agents, advanced tools, and GPU-accelerated platforms to develop intelligent, self-scaling systems. My expertise spans designing solutions that emphasize reliability, security, self-isolation, and stateful mapping as code. This includes working with custom-defined resources and adopting practices such as AIOps, MLOps, DevSecOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). I have extensive experience in implementing near real-time metrics and data aggregation with event tracking, processing terabytes of data across diverse projects. My background includes designing scalable distributed computing solutions to effectively manage large-scale data. In the banking and finance sector, I have developed software solutions focused on reactive streams, metrics, performance tracking, fault-tolerant event handling, and dashboard creation. My work also encompasses Manufacturing Execution System (MES) software development for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, adhering to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. Additionally, I have contributed to robotics solutions for microchip fabrication (CPU, NAND), including FOUP transport and management, with specialized expertise in SECS and HSMS protocols.
