### About

Acting as subject matter expert, immediate interests represented with self-scalable k8s-cluster-aware and self-healing apps, based on near real-time metrics with focus on reliability, security, self-isolation and instantaneous stateful mapping as code, including custom defined resources, also AIOps, MLOps, DevSecOps, all in scope of SRE. I have been implementing near real-time data aggregation, event tracking, event driven processing for terabytes of data in various projects (aka asset classes). A benchmark would be from ca. 1 billion data points a set per minute, hour, day, week, month depending on type of metric, format and need. I developed scalable distributed computing solutions to achieve that. Earlier I was developing software for banking and finance (reactive streams, metrics and performance tracking, fault tolerant event handling, portals and dashboarding), also components of Manufacturing Execution System (MES) software for pharma and biotech (GMP), and robotics solutions for microchip FABs (CPU and NAND), FOUP transport and management (SECS, HSMS).
