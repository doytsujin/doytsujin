#### About

As a Subject Matter Expert, I bring domain-spanning knowledge with strong interdisciplinary problem-solving capabilities in frontend development, distributed systems, data analytics, cloud architecture, and system reliability. My focus lies in leveraging intelligent agents, advanced developer tooling, and GPU-accelerated platforms to build true scalable, self-adaptive systems.

This includes designing solutions that emphasize reliability, security, self-isolation, and infrastructure-as-code principles, using custom-defined resources and declarative stateful mapping. I apply practices from AIOps, MLOps, DevSecOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to ensure operational excellence and long-term maintainability.

I have extensive experience implementing near real-time metrics, telemetry, and event tracking pipelines, processing terabytes of data across diverse environments. My background includes architecting distributed computing systems capable of handling large-scale data workloads with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance.

In the banking and finance domain, I have developed software centered on reactive streams, performance analytics, resilient event handling, and interactive dashboards. In the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors, I’ve contributed to Manufacturing Execution System (MES) platforms aligned with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. Additionally, I’ve supported robotics and automation solutions for microchip fabrication (CPU, NAND), including FOUP transport and management systems, with deep technical expertise in SECS and HSMS protocols.
